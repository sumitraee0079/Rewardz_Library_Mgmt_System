# Rewardz_Library_Mgmt_System

In this project, we will develop a library management system that will help us in performing various functions like adding, issuing, and returning books. It will also store the issue and returning date of the book and the fine on the book if the book is not returned. Furthermore, the data of books that are stored can be edited and deleted.
